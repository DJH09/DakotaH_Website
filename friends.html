                My best friend Bailee, in your eyes, I can see my future with you in it.<br>
                With us seeing the world and doing so many more things. Your smile brings warmth throughout my body,<br>
                and I can feel a sense of love. Every time you smile it just makes me smile even bigger to see my favorite person so happy.<br>
                You give the best hugs to anyone I've met. Your hugs are so warm and comforting and just hearing your voice soothes me.<br>
                Always remember that I will be with you through all your ups and downs, whether you want a hug or a shoulder to cry on to feel some support,<br>
                I will always be there for you and I always want to be.

                My best man, Cameron. You have always been there for me during my ups and downs and I want to be there for yours.<br>
                I appreciate you being my first friend during my move to my new school and for that you will always have a special place in my heart.<br>
                If you would take them I would give you so many hugs to show you how grateful I am to have a friend like you in my life.<br>
                Hopefully throughout life's challenges, we can have a little fun, maybe get the cops called on us once or twice without getting arrested.<br>
                I will still continue to convince you to let me speak at your future wedding.
