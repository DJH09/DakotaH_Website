                I'm Dakota and I've been doing coding for the past few years. I first got into coding when I was in 8th grade and made a few small projects here and there to learn the basics. I learned code in C# for the Unity game engine but the projects were always micro and for learning purposes. In 9th grade, I took a Computer Science Essentials class where I continued to learn how to code, but instead of learning C#, I learned to code in Python. I did projects as simple as small calculation apps and even dug into the world of coding a website with Flask and HTML. In 10th grade, I took the AP Computer Science Principles class to learn more principles of coding.
