I heard u talking ab me to customers, asking if im checking anyone else out, but to that I answer your the most beautiful girl and I cant take my eyes of u.

And it doesnt matter that dylana says u shouldnt date, u can make ur own decisions. If you are willing to wait for me, then you will be able to date me. But whether we date or not, im still gonna show u how u should be treated and make sure u know that ur the most special girl in the world. I want to show u im not like ur exs and am not going to intentionally hurt u. Just promise me you will keep smiling because ur smile takes my breath away. I want to see you smile more, I want to know that ur happy. I love u and never forget that u mean something to me, more than u know❤️`

Your humor always cracks me up when u try to be funny. In your eyes, I can see a girl who has never quite been treated right, but imma show u how u should be treated. Im gonna show u that u should be treated like the beautiful soul you are. You are an angel that fell outta heaven. And i just wanna say, whether u think ur doing anything wrong or right, with me, you have done so much right. More than I can even explain. You are enough and always will be. U are the toughest person I know, and I want u by my side with me on this journey of life, because u mean a lot to me. I Can never say it enough. Ik you felt like everyone hates u or thinks your always making the wrong choices, but to me, I will love you for who u are and be there by ur side whether ur right or wrong.

Gonna keep this short and sweet because I just wanted to take a minute to reconize the sweetest girl Ive ever met with the biggest heart and the most beautiful soul. You are more than enough to me. It doesnt matter if u dont put on makeup or if u think u have a bad hair day, in my eyes, i will always see the most perfect girl, an angel in disguise. You are the best thing to happen to me. I really hope to never lose you as it would leave me heartbroken. I love you so much, more than u know. I will always be there to pick u up when u fall. I will always make sure u know how much u mean and how pretty you really are. I will always be there, for you. I know you like me and I like you too. Ive put a little bit of thought into it.

I honestly cant imagine my life without u. I thank god everyday for putting u in my life, cuz you are the best thing to ever happen to me, I literally dont deserve you. I have always seen myself as ugly, yet somehow I was blessed with you, so beautiful, literally drop dead Gorgeous  I wish you could realise how I see you, straight beauty, most beautiful person in the universe. You are the only thing I know that makes flowers look boring compared to your beauty. I dont need a picture perfect life that everyone always talks and dreams about, I just need you. I hope we can be together forever, cuz I love you and wanna make so many memories with u. I wanna make you smile, make you life, realise that you are a amazing person even tho you dont think you are. You have given me proof, that there really are angels on earth, because you are one. I promise you, you are more than enough just the way you are, and I will make sure you never think otherwise.

Although at work you kept tapping my ass so I might need to just randomly grab a handful of yours so we are even 😝. I love you so much and I always will, since we are married. Does that mean we gonna have a child soon? Lol. I hope you know that I love seeing you smile. Like when you smiled today at work, made my night. I will always be there for you, to make sure that you laugh. I hope you feel safe with me. (which you should since according to you im fat and have man titties, plenty protection there.)

I just wanted to remind you about how proud you make everyday. Im lucky to be able to call u my gf because you make my world better in ways I cant even describe. You run around in my mind all day, im literally always thinking ab u every minutes of every day. I wish I could hold u in my arms right now, show u how much I care about u. Even just doing that wouldnt prove to u how much u mean to me. You are literally my favorite part of every single day savannah higdon- i mean klein, savannah klein. U literally make my heart warmer just by being yourself. No matter what happens in this game of life, i promise u that u will always have me right here on ur side supporting u with everything u do.

While you may think I look at you as just a really beautiful girl with a big ass, thats not all I see. I see the kindness in your heart and the strength you carry with your beautiful soul that makes my day better just by being yourself. You are the sunshine in my darkest days and im glad I, Dakota Higdon, get to call u my girlfriend because you mean the absolute world to me. If I had to write a list of all of the things I love about you, I think Id go through the worlds paper supply because in my eyes, all I see is a wonderful girl that I wanna spend the rest of my days with. (and no, the papers wont just have your ass written over and over again as much as I love that, I love a lot more of you a whole bunch more, I told you I would wait til you are ready and comfortable for things like that and kissing and whatnot). I could name so many things about you that I love like your eyes, your hair, your face, your smile, your personality, your humor, etc. And most importantly is the parts of u that no one can see. Your heart and your soul. You just have a way of making everything feel okay when your around and I hope I make you feel the same because you deserve true love, a kind of love that isnt going to use you for your body and play with your feelings. A love that you feel comfortable enough around that you have no filter and can talk to about anything, someone who you can always go to when your down and someone who wont yell at you for ever little mistake. I want to be that someone for you. I want to hug you and never let go. I want to tell you your perfect to me in every way possible over and over again. I love you so fucking much that you have no idea how hard it is not to kiss you every time you smile and look at me lookin hella cute. Knowing that you are mine makes me feel like the luckiest person alive and I cant wait to make memories with you. Once you are ungrounded, I REALLY REALLY want us to hang out someway whether we just go on a walk, we hang out at eachothers houses, or even as much as going to the mall or movies or something. I wanna spend EVERY minute with you and its hard that I cant even do that. But ill manage, because I love you too much. Like I love you soooooooooooo much. -Your true love, Kota Bota XOXO`

When we first started \"talking\" after u found out that u and cameron couldnt be, ngl, I was skeptical and nervous. I had this stunning amazing girl with a beautiful heart throwing herself all over me because she liked me, and then there was me. I didnt know whether or not to believe that it was true and even debated whether or not I should have actually asked you out or if it was too good to be true. But since the day that i did, you have made me the happiest and I couldnt ask for a better girl to be my side and that I get to call mine. You are perfect just the way you are, and I wouldnt change anything about you, you are truly amazing. You deserve the world and I may not be able to give it all to you, but ill give it my all to make you the happiest youve ever been. Im excited to make so many memories with you as always. However, there is something you should know about me. Even if you dont want to know, im going to tell you. (sound familiar?) when I said my love language is physical touch, I really mean it. (Just a warning cuz im always gonna want hugs and you to hold my hand and put your hand on my thigh and cuddles (yes even in school)) Ill even hold you in my arms in front of all the girls that you think are prettier than you (even tho you are the prettiest) just to prove to you that when I say your the only girl I want, I mean it. I love you my sweetheart, and I always will and I do hope you are happy in the relationship and feel supported and safe and I want you to be open about it. If you are, tell me so ik im doing something right. If im doing something wrong, also tell me so I can fix it. I want you to be happy. Again, Love you Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo much.\n\nXOXO - Kota Bota`

const todaysMessage = `HEY HUNNYYYYY!!!! I hope you had a good day at work today. Sorry I decided not to go. Anyways. to start I just wanted to say, I am still mad at you for something. I'm still mad at you for going fishing for the first time and catching a fish like right away. How dare you. I didn't even get to catch anything. Regardless, I'm still glad that you had fun and maybe we will get to do it again sometime. I also wanted to tell you that Ik with school starting, not only will we have less time to talk which will make me sad, but I also know that there is a chance you are going to get stressed over your school work. It's bound to happen. But please never feel like you are on your own for your school work because you aren't. If you need help, don't feel afraid to ask. I understand that sometimes school can be stressful but I am always here when you need me no matter what it is. If you need me to stay up til 3am on call with you so you have me to do dmacc with, trust me I'll be on call with you. All just so I can show you that you aren't alone. Not only in school work, but you aren't alone at all. I deeply care about you and what you are feeling, and I want you to feel safe enough to openly say anything that you are feeling whether school was terrible and you just need to rant to me or if something happen that makes you upset and you need someone to cry to. I don't just wanna be there with you when you are happy, I also wanna be there with you the rest of the time, because we are a team and your feelings matter to me too. I also know that with school starting up, I'm gonna be the luckiest guy at the homecoming dance because I'm gonna get to go with you. I'll get some nice flowers to give to you and I'll even make a sign for you to do a Homecoming Proposal or whatever when you hang out with me at some point again. I'm excited for our first dance and I hope you are too. It may be our first school dance together, but it for sure isn't gonna be our last I'll tell you that because I am not gonna give up our relationship. You make me the happiest I have ever felt in a long time and I want it to stay that way. You know just how to hug me when we get to see each other again, you always find a way to make me smile someway, you very kindly beat me when I act up, and you may be short but you still the boss lol. Still in all seriousness, you are a really good girlfriend. In a lifetime, I couldn't ever find anyone else that treats me just the way you do and I hope you feel the same. Sure our relationship might not be the kinda love you might see in the movies. It has its flaws and its time where it may seem a little bad, but together we always find a way to make it work because we know that in the end, its not you vs me, its us against everything else. There is no one else I would rather spend my life  with then you. I want your beautiful, glowing green eyes to be the last eyes I see before I go to bed. I want your smile to be the first thing I see every morning when we get up out of bed only to find out your hair is frizzy and my hair is all over the place and goofy. I want you to be the last girl (besides our future daughter) that I hold in my arms. I've given you my heart, trusting you enough to not break it. I trust you with my whole life and soul. You may have fallen for me, but I only fell harder. You were the unexpected love that came into my life, the love I didn't know I needed until you came along. Everything about you just makes me happy on the inside, from the fact that you can cry tears of happiness or even sadness but always point to the fact that your mascara is going everywhere to the fact that you always try to make sure I know that you are always right. Oh and also while I'm thinking about it, if you ever think I'm gonna break up with you, just know 2 things. 1, my mom loves you so much that I couldn't stand to see her hurt from it, so I will always try my damn hardest to work it out with you. and 2, I have spent way too damn long writing after work messages and spent too much damn money on monster energy drinks to see you smile for me to just give up on our relationship. Anyways, besides that, always remember that you are like a sunflower, because you shine and stand beautifully, and I love you so very much wifey, never forget that.

- - Huzz

P.S. The reason I said to not talk to me and avoided talking to you while you were hanging with your friends is because I wanted to make sure that you got to hang out with them rather than spend half the time texting me. Oh and btw, you told my dad that you were gonna move out when you were 18, does that mean at 18 you are gonna go live with morgan? if so it better not be super far away so I can still visit you (even though apparently you think im coming with lol). Idk, you can either text me it or tell me on call cuz im genuinely curious.`;
