        <h1>Oh look at this here, you found the secret page</h1>
        <p>
            Now I'm going to tell you even more about how much you really mean to me. This will basically be the spot where I will have the most writing ever about how important you are to me. This will include previous writing and new writings.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the day that I first met you, I never realized how much you would actually mean to me. We started talking about the most random things I'm sure and I didn't know what to think since you had previously blocked me, but I'm glad I allowed you to add me on snap again because it would change both of our lives for the better.
        </p>
        <p>
            We had some good times when we were just friends. Some of my favorite memories of that time were some of the sendits that you had done of me, including one where you said I was your best friend along with many others and I was terrible at clarinet, yes, you did actually say that.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a while of getting to know each other, the day had come. December 30. I may have asked you out in the most nerdy way possible but I know for a fact that you still smile so much knowing that I decided to ask you out like that and be a goofball. Little did I know, that was the start of some of the best months for the both of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember we had to keep it a secret for a while and then eventually the word got out, we were dating. This was the time period where I would start to show you what true love really is and first remind you to just be yourself and that I would always be there for you no matter what it was.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had my first time hanging out at a friend's house in a long time and that person’s house I got to hang out at was yours. I know for a fact that you enjoyed it, you got to not only feel loved, but also have a good time taking ridiculous videos of me being goofy. Yep, that was great, we even got to do it a second time and go on a walk together.
        </p>
        <p>
            We even went to the crystal ball together. I remember first picking you up and taking you to a fancy 5 star restaurant with expensive food— I mean, Perkins. We had to look at each other and laugh at the fact that we couldn’t answer questions about each other that my dad was asking.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then finally we got to slow dance together at the dance to our song. I want you to know that I enjoyed all of those moments so very much and I know you did too because I could tell you finally found your person, and I want to continue to be that person that you feel safe and comfortable around and that you feel you can talk to about anything.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we had many good times, we did have a bad time. We broke up. However, you did learn something from this experience that would continue to change your life. I wasn’t like all of the other guys, even though we broke up, I still wanted to continue to be your best friend and change your life for the better. I wanted to make you the happiest girl in the world because you deserve more than you think you do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Even though we were no longer dating, we still continued to have a good time and in my opinion, I think the time from when we broke up til now was better than before we broke up. I think we became a lot closer after some time after the breakup and you finally realized that I was there to stay and I wanted to be.
        </p>
        <p>
            I could see something in your eyes that nobody else could see, I could see such a beautiful soul and such a beautiful person that had never been treated right. You deserve more than you think you do because you are such an awesome person.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can't ever seem to tell you enough that your smile brings the brightest sunshine in my days. It doesn't matter if I just had the shittiest day ever, after seeing you smile, my day is instantly better. Your hugs as always are so warm and comforting that they just make my heart melt. You have such a great personality on top of all of this.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are the kindest, caring person I know, yet you still know how to be so funny and make life not so boring. I hope you know that I want to continue to be your friend from now until forever. I want to be there with you so you have someone that you feel you can open up your feelings to, someone you can come to if you need a hug or a shoulder to cry on, or someone who is just there to make sure that you have a good time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I want you in my future and complete everything on our bucket list and more. I love you so much Belleame, more than you could even imagine, and I always will, from now until forever.
